# Kali Linux Alternatives

Kali Linux is an operating system software distribution that was intuitively developed for security auditing and penetration testing. There are several tools built to assist Kali Linux in completing the tasks of its building intent. Kali Linux is a Debian-based distribution that offers more than just an operating system and includes pre-built packages and pre-compiled software for quick installation on the user's workstation. It was previously known as "BackTrack" under a different operating system distribution. In this tutorial, we will discuss various Kali Linux alternatives and why and when they should be used for the best benefit.
